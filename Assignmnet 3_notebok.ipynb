    "- Question: which termination methods are available (introduced in the exercise) and what are they best used for and what are the potential issues?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "- TextMentionTermination: The TextMentionTermination is a method which checks for the particular keyword and stops the team. If the termination condition met, then the team will stop. For example, if the word \"Done\" detected then the team will stop running the agents. If a keyword like \"DONE\" appears in the response, the system stops generating text. This is useful for signaling the completion of a task, when the meal plan for the whole day is finalized, the system stops with \"DONE\". The potential issues with this method is if the keyword is mentioned unintentionally or in different context then it might stop the team and conversation will be terminated (e.g. if \"DONE\" is a part of recipe or cooking instruction). To improve this, complex keyword can be used such as \"MEALPLANDONE\" this keyword has a lower chance of showing up in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MaxMessageTermination: If the certain number of messages is exceeded, the system stops producing response. Upside is to limit messages length when outputting text. The potential issues with this method is it might end the conversation before the task is even completed. It might cut off important or useful information if the limit is set too low, regardless of whether the planning is complete.\n",
    " \n",
    "- HandoffTermination: This method stops the teams when the agent sends a HandoffMessage which targets another user or agent. Useful when the system wants to have input from the user, for example, if the system wants to know if the user like the meal plan that it makes at any paricular part of the day. Also if the cost is exceeds the budget, the team can ask what item the user wants to keep. The challenge here is ensuring the handoff only sent message when it really needs to. The team can stop unexpectedly if the handoff message sent unintentionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "- TimeTermination: The system stops after a specific time period. This could ensure that meal planning doesn't take too long, the issue here is if the timing is too short, the planning might not be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ExternalTermination: set() is a external termination method which stops the team when the current agent turn is over. This method allows the current agent to complete its turn and share the message to the team before stopping the teams. The potential issue is it can delay the termination when it is waiting for the current agent turn to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question: why is it important to have a termination condition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "- Its important to have a termination condition otherwise the agents might continue running indefinitely which lead to infinite loop. It will cause the unnecesary compute and time consumtion. When the agent runs indefinitely then it take the resources for other agents and tasks. However, by using the termination condition, resources can be managed efficiently. Secondly, it is handy when we precisely want the agent to complete a task in define timeframe and to not make the user overwhelmed by a irrelevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question: Can the approaches be combined?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "- Yes, the approach can be combined for more robust control. For example, use TextMentionTerminaiton with a keyword to stop once it appears. However, if the word doesn't show up due to internal errors or miscommunication, the MaxMessageTermination can stop after the agent exceeds the limit of the number of messages. So, we can both combine the approach (TextMentionTermination and MaxMessageTermination) to stop the team either when a specific keyword deteched or to stop it when we have enough number of ineteractions. So, we can use a team of agents with termination conditions to achieve a task.\n"

    "- Question: What are the drawbacks of this approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- Fixed Message Limit: this method put a hard cap on the number of messages. This leads to premature termination in the meal planning process. If the agents are still working to adjust the meals plan after its exceed the budget, the process will stop, leaving the plan incomplete.\n",
    "- Iterations: When the meals plan is exceeded, the might be more than one iteration needed, each iteration increases the number of the messages, which could reach the limit before a good solution is reached. This make the process inefficient, costing time and output token.\n",
    "- Economic: Each message or interaction in the system costs fee, from API calls to token usage. Iterations produce more cost. Lengthy texts cause inconvinients for the user.\n",
    "- Potential miscommunication: From the setup, if one agent misses a message from another, there's a risk of miscommunication.\n",
    "- Scalability issues: As the complexity of the imput prompt from the user increases, this method might not scale well with modifications. The structure might reach a bottleneck for complex meals plan.\n",
    "- No feedback loop: The approach doesn't ask inputs from the user, making things hard to customize."

    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Agent Systems** allow specialized agents to collaboratively solve tasks, with each agent focusing on a specific role (e.g., meal planning, budget validation).\n",
    "\n",

    "    - **Agent Setup:** Defining agents with specific roles and integrating tools like the Budget Checker.\n",
    "    - **Coordination Mechanisms:** Using methods like `RoundRobinGroupChat` to manage agent interactions."
